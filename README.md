# krmp.cc

Inspired by the color css declarations seen in [materialize](http://materializecss.com/color.html), the goal of this project is to provide on-the-fly css classes who's only responsibility is to manipulate `color` and `background-color` properties.

## Using

Stylsheets are generated by the application based on parameters provided to it in the url. To add the stylsheet to you application, simply add a `<link />` element pointed to the `krmp.cc` host:

```html
<link href="https://krmp.cc" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

By default, this will generate css classes for a "_palette_" with the [default settings](https://github.com/dadleyy/krmp.cc/blob/master/krmp/request_runtime.go#L10-L15). Ultimately, the code generated looks like:

```css
.bg-1 { background-color: #6aa7d9; }
.fg-1 { color: #6aa7d9; }
.bg-1.darken-1 { background-color: #649dcc; }
.fg-1.darken-1 { color: #649dcc; }
```

These rules could then be applied to your application's markup through `class` attributes:

```html
<div class="bg-1 darken-1"></div>
```

### Customization

The following parameters can be added to the url (as query string parameters) in order to customize the generated palette:

| Name | Type | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| base | `hex` | The color from which to start the palette. Should not contain leading `#`. |
| steps | `number` | The amount of adjustments to make to the hue. |
| shades | `boolean` | If set to `false`, the generated css will not include `lighten`/`darken` classes for shades. |
| shade_min | `number` | Used to determine the minimum brightness of shades to generate. (0 - 100) |
| shade_max | `number` | Used to determine the maxium brightness of shades to generate. (0 - 100) |
| expanded | `boolean` | If set to `true`, the generated css will _not_ be minified. |

Instead of providing `base` as a query parameter, it can be directly inserted in the url path: [`/428aa7`](https://krmp.cc/428aa7)


### Previewing

To preview any styesheet, add `/preview` to the url path:

* [`/428aa7/preview`](https://krmp.cc/428aa7/preview)
* [`/preview?base=428aa7`](https://krmp.cc/preview?base=428aa7)
